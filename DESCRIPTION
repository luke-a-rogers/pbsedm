Description: Implements some methods of empirical dynamic modelling (EDM) for nonlinear time-series analysis. The name `pbsEDM` combines our workplace, the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in British Columbia, Canada, with EDM, continuing a long tradition of R packages from PBS. The package was developed in conjuction with a manuscript currently under review.
