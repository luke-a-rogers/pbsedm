\title{Create movie to explain EDM}
\usage{
plot_explain_edm_movie(obj, inc.rEDM = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{list object of class `pbsEDM`, an output from `pbsEDM()`}

\item{inc.rEDM}{logical whether to include rEDM calculation figure and in legend.}

\item{...}{extra values to use in calls to `plot_explain_edm()`; needs to include tstar}
}
\value{
movie (if used with gifski) to explain EDM; if combined with
  `par(mfrow=c(4,2))` (and not gifski) then will give multiple panels, but
  borders etc have not been set up properly for this and will need adjusting
}
\description{
Use with gifski in .Rmd - see `analyse_simple_time_series` vignette. Also
 called from `plot_explain_edm_movie_save` to save a pdf that can be
 incremented through in the Appendix.
