\title{Plot data and results of an object of class `pbsEDM` as time series and
phase plots}
\usage{
\method{plot}{pbsEDM}(x, portrait = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{list object of class `pbsEDM`, an output from `pbsEDM()`}

\item{portrait}{if TRUE then plots panels in portrait mode for manuscripts/Rmarkdown (3x2), false is
landscape (2x3, filled columnwise) for presentations.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed onto other plotting functions,
in particular `last.time.to.plot` to plot only up to that time step (to
loop through in a movie), and late.num to plot the final number of time
steps in a different colour, or label.cex for (a) etc. label sizes.}
}
\value{
Five panels in 2x3 or 3x2 format, in current plot environment
}
\description{
Plots time series of `N_t` and `Y_t`, 2d phase plots of `N_t` vs `N_{t-1}`
and `Y_t` vs `Y_{t-1}`, and 3d phase plot of `Y_t` vs `Y_{t-1}` vs `Y_{t-2}`.
See vignette "Analyse a simple time series".
Only working if `N$N_t` values are in there (needs another switch if
not). And very likely only works for univariate time series for now, not
pred-prey for example.
