An R package to implement some of the methods of empirical dynamic modelling

This package complements our new paper:

Edwards, A.M, L.A. Rogers, and C.A. Holt (2024). Explaining empirical dynamic modelling using verbal, graphical and mathematical approaches. *Ecology and Evolution*, 14:e10903, 1-12. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10903 

Part of the Supporting Information is a narrated movie (based on animations produced by this package), downloadable [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1002%2Fece3.10903&file=ece310903-sup-0002-MovieS1.zipo).

The package implements the simplex and S-map algorithms of empirical dynamic modelling (EDM), and creates visualisations to help understand the methods, for example:

Users can also analyse their own data. The package can be installed directly from GitHub (see instructions below).

The name `pbsEDM` combines two acronyms - PBS (our workplace, the Pacific Biological Station, in British Columbia, Canada) and EDM. 

## Vignettes

The vignettes are already rendered here:

* [analyse_simple_time_series.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pbs-assess/pbsEDM/blob/master/vignettes/analyse_simple_time_series.html) How to analyse a simple time series using the simplex algorithm, and produce figures that help understand the algorithm.
* [aspect_2.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pbs-assess/pbsEDM/blob/master/vignettes/aspect_2.html) Detailing of aspect 2.
* [negative_predictions.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pbs-assess/pbsEDM/blob/master/vignettes/negative_predictions.html) Demonstrations of getting negative predictions, and also how the correlation coefficients differ between looking at predictions of lagged values and predictions of the actual population values.
* [pbsSmap.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pbs-assess/pbsEDM/blob/master/vignettes/pbsSmap.html) Demonstration of S-map code.

The source code written in `Rmarkdown`, the R code that gets extracted from the
`Rmarkdown` code, and the resulting .html files are all found within your library
folder (where all your R libraries get saved), in
`library\pbsEDM\doc\`. Or you can look at the `vignettes\` folder on GitHub or locally. Terms like `aspect 2' will make more sense upon reading of the manuscript.

## To reproduce and save the figures for the manuscript

Just run the following code. Type the function name (or look at the help with ?<function_name>) to see what it does.

```
E_results <- pbsEDM_Evec(NY_lags_example$N_t)

plot_pbsEDM_Evec_save(E_results)      # Figure 1

plot_explain_edm_save(E_results[[1]]) # Figure 2

plot_rho_Evec_save()                  # Figure 3

plot_library_size_save()              # Figure 4 

# Animated figures for the Appendix:

plot_pbsEDM_Evec_movie_save(E_results)                # Figure A.1

plot_explain_edm_movie_save(E_results[[1]])           # Figure A.2 

plot_explain_edm_all_tstar_movie_save(E_results[[1]]) # Figure A.3
```

## Installation instructions

```
install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package
remotes::install_github("pbs-assess/pbsEDM")
```

If you get an error like
```
Error in utils::download.file(....)
```
then the connection may be timing out. Try
```
options(timeout = 1200)
```
and then try and install again.

## Background

Our motivation for this work was initially to fully understand the steps of EDM, which led to us writing this package. As described in our paper: 

Our intention is for pbsEDM to complement the popular R package [rEDM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rEDM) and its [tutorial](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/rEDM/blob/master/vignettes/rEDM-tutorial.pdf), plus the Python package [pyEDM](https://pepy.tech/project/pyEDM), to aid understanding and reproducibility. All intermediate calculations are available as output in pbsEDM and all code is in R, while rEDM contains C++ code (which is faster than R code but less readable than R to many ecologists); however, rEDM and pyEDM also include advanced algorithms that are not in pbsEDM. 

## Citation

If you use our package then please cite it so that we can keep track and will continue to update it. See citation("pbsEDM") for a bibTeX entry, or use:
